## Strategy

Design a site with a focused style that does not distract from the Simon Says game. Consistent fonts, feedback sounds and colors will be used throughout the design for a visual appeal and simplicity.

## Scope

1. Create a Simon Says style game where the objective of the game is obvious and easy to understand.
2. Create a game that is fair and challenging at the same time.
3. Create different game modes.
4. Create a scoreboard.
5. Incorporate cheats, such as being able to skip a level.
6. Include audiovisual feedback.

## Bugs & Fixes

15/12/2021 - Bug identified where repeating objects in playGameChoice weren't animating correctly. This was fixed by adjusting the setTimeout to i*1000 to create delay in the iteration of the gameChoice array.
16/12/2021 - Bug identified where testChoice() kept defaulting to the else statement, the for loop needed adjusting so that it iterated through a slice of gameChoice that was equivalent to the length of userChoice. In code, it meant changing userChoice[i] === gameChoice[i] to userChoice[i] === gameChoice.slice(0, userChoice.length)[i].
18/12/2021 - 21/12/2021 - Bug identified where testChoice() would default to the next round regardless of whether the last choice was correct or incorrect. This was corrected for by having two overall if statements. The first tested if the userChoice < gameChoice in length, if it was, it iterated through the array for the length of userChoice and tested for equality. If equal, continue, if not equal, game over. The second tested whether the arrays are equal in length. If equal, a further test is done to check whether the last object in each array are equivalent. If they are equivalent, next round, if they aren't equivalent, game over.
26/12/2021 - Scores variable only returns a number if a number is declared. Specifying a number in another manner such as array.length returns 0. Resolved by using the original level variable as opposed to declaring a new variable, the score is the level.
27/12/2021 - Bug where if scoreList is empty, logic error. Resolved by moving pushScore inside of checkScore function.
